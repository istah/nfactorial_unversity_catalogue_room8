# University Catalog Room 8

AI-assisted FastAPI backend scaffold for managing a university catalog. This repository follows the multi-agent workflow outlined in `AGENTS.md` and stores the backend service under `backend/`.

## Structure

- `AGENTS.md` – describes the AI agents, roles, and constraints for contributions.
- `backend/` – FastAPI application using an application factory pattern. See `backend/README.md` for usage instructions.

## Development Notes

All contributions should follow the agent guidelines, use explicit imports, and maintain modular files for future database and documentation work. Additional services (database, migrations, etc.) will be layered on as the project evolves.
